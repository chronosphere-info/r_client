# Change log of the R package 'chronosphere'

# chronosphere 0.5.0 - 2023-05-23
### Added
- the configure() function to support setting of global variables: curl, timeout and remote (debugging)
- tinytest - dependencies
- curl as suggest, curl support for datasets() and fetch()
- new  Example data to show the use of datadir

### Removed
- plate tectonic reconstruction related functionality to package 'rgplates'

- shaper() function, color palettes() to 'restools' (to be published soon)

# [0.4.1] - 2021-04-16 (build 80)
### Added 
- added the platemodel example to the package's files
- fixed wrong example

# [0.4.0] - 2020-10-18 (build 79 - CRAN submission take 2)
### Added 
- vignette url fix


# [0.4.0] - 2020-10-18 (build 78 - Initial CRAN submission)
### Added 
- minor fixes


# [0.4.0 (build 77)] - 2020-10-13
### Added
- package collate in DESCRIPTION
- The SpatialArray class is added to the package, mimicking RasterArrays for vector objects. 
- The SpatialList class is added, to be used in the SpatialStack. 
- The XArray class-union is made for the efficient generalization of methods shared by RasterArray and SpatialArray. Shared methods are impplemented.
- the spTransform() function is implemented for SpatialStacks and SpatialArrays.
- the apply() function gained the MARGIN=NULL submethod. THis submethod is useful for the iteration of functions for every XArray item.
- The mapedge() function for the quick calculation of map edges in non-equirectangular projections.
- the 'coasts' data demo object of the PaleoMAP Paleocoastlines
- types() generic and SpatialArray-method is added.


### Changed
- Multiple RasterArray methods are now generalized for the XArray and are no longer specific to RasterArrays.
- vignette was renamed from chronos.Rmd to chronosphere.Rmd, references to 'clim' were removed and uses 'coasts' now instead

### Removed
- the reporting tools added in build 75 are removed as they require further testing
- the 'clim' demo object was removed to decrease the size of the package

### Known issues/missing features
- SpatialArrays and SpatialStacks do not have a default plotting method yet.
- The apply() function has limit utility on SpatialArrays.
- rare issues with res/ver defaulting, use explicit ver and res to ensure correct download

# [0.3.1 (build 76)] - 2020-09-23
### Added
- Forced UTF-8 encoding for the registry tables
- added API call to chronosphere object attributes.

# [0.3.1 (build 75)] - 2020-09-20
### Added
- create_metadata() and report() to create data report based on the pbdb download
- generate_bib() and related functions to generate bibliography for report
- capitalize() to capitalise strings - for formatting purposes
- pkg_file() to access files within the package
- template files to inst/rmarkdown/

# [0.3.1 (build 74)] - 2020-08-20
### Added
- The SpatialLinesDataFrame-method of the reconstruct() function.


# [0.3.1 (build 73)] - 2020-08-07
### Added
- The reference() and info() functions. The new reference() function is now used within fetch().

### Fixed
- minor bugs.


# [0.3.0 (build 72)] - 2020-07-30
### Added
- The 'plateperiod' argument was accidentally deleted during update to build 69, now it is live again. 


# [0.3.0 (build 71)] - 2020-07-14
### Changed
- Fixed forced download of registry table when datadir was given and data were already present on disk/storage device


# [0.3.0 (build 70)] - 2020-06-11
### Added
- datasets() function gained the 'dat', 'master'  and 'greetings' arguments. The default setting of the function only downloads the list of datasets (dat) and variables (var). Setting the 'dat' argument to a character entry will download the list of all archives from that dataset. Setting the master argument to 'master=TRUE' will download a list of all archives, which is expected to be very long in the near future. The argument 'greetings=TRUE' will display a reminder that additional versions and resolutions are available.
- the downloaded objects now have chronosphere attributes. These record the accession information used previously, which allows the repetition of function call, if necessary - including changes.
- fetch() can return the function call, using call=TRUE. This can be either an expression or a terminal message, depending on the settings of call.expr=TRUE/FALSE.
- fetch() can be used with an already downloaded the chronosphere-object to either redownload it, or get its download function call.
- fetch() can be used to return multiple variables from the same dataset. These will be concatenated into a list, unless they are RasterArrays, in which case fetch() will try to cbind() them
- the extent() method of the RasterArray class
- the server log log.csv is only checked once per session.

### Removed
- The dataindex() deprecated placeholder function was removed. Use datasets() instead.
- previous updates to reconstruct()
